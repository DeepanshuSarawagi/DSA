    Insertion Sort algorithm is also an in-place algorithm like Bubble Sort and Selection Sort
    It has a time complexity of quadratic. Which means for every 100 elements, it would take 10,000 steps to sort them
    The Big O notation value is O(n^2).
    It is a stable algorithm, which means we the position of two identical elements in an array will not be changed
    while performing sort operation.
